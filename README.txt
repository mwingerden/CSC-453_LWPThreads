No special instructions

Sometimes there is a lag when running numbersmain.c. I couldn't figure
out what was causing this lag. Also, I couldn't get hungyrsnakes.c and
randomsnakes.c to work. Compiling the two separately worked, but I couldn't
figure the reason for why it didn't run as in the demo on execution.

Nothing else to consider.
